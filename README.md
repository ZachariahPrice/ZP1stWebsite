# ZP1stWebsite
What is this website?

This is a website that I made during the 1st week of studying at MIT. This websites is part of an exercise that we had to complete. The website itself is very basic, as we were just beginners.

I will not be adding more to the website. 


If you do download it, do not edit and publish it onto the internet pretending it to be your own work.
