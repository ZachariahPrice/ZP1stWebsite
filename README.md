# ZP1stWebsite
What is this website?

This was made during week 1 of my class studying at MIT. It looks horrible yes, but it's just a basic website where we learning html and css. 
I will not be adding more to it, but will add more projects in the future. 

In terms of usuage, it's just viewing it, theres not much you can do with it.
